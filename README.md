Hi!

I followed a YouTube tutorial by ProgrammingWithNick to create a Retro Snake game. The link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGqsnM_WEK4. 

Because I was unable to import any files I was unable to add textures or sounds, so I omitted those. 

Some of the code may be a bit different but most of them are similar if not the same to ProgrammingWithNick's. This was only to learn more about the methods of creating a game with C++ and raylib.
